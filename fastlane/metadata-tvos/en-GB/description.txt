TableTogether brings your household together with effortless meal planning while respecting personal privacy.

PLAN TOGETHER, COOK WITH CONFIDENCE
Share recipes and weekly meal plans with family or housemates in real-time. Drag recipes onto a visual week planner, copy last week's plan, or start fresh. Smart suggestions learn your household's favourites and surface new ideas.

RECIPES — THREE WAYS IN
• Build recipes by hand with full ingredient and macro tracking
• Import from any recipe website with automatic parsing
• Generate custom recipes with AI based on ingredients you have, cooking style, time available, and dietary needs

GROCERY LISTS THAT THINK
Mark what's already in your pantry. TableTogether intelligently aggregates ingredients across all planned meals and creates shopping lists organised by aisle. See which meals need each ingredient.

COOKING MODE
Full-screen step-by-step guidance with large text, ingredient checklist, and built-in timer. Designed for messy hands and busy kitchens.

PERSONAL NUTRITION TRACKING (OPTIONAL)
Log meals privately — never shared with your household. Three ways to log:
• Select from planned meals
• "Describe what you ate" with on-device AI estimation
• Manual macro entry

Track daily and weekly macro trends with calm, judgment-free insights. Set personal nutrition goals or skip tracking entirely. Connect Apple Health to write nutrition data automatically.

YOUR KITCHEN ON YOUR TV
Display today's meals on Apple TV like a kitchen whiteboard. See what's cooking, who's eating, and when to start preparing. No personal data — just shared meal plans.

REAL-TIME HOUSEHOLD SYNC
Collaborate seamlessly via iCloud. Multiple people can plan, edit recipes, and check off grocery items simultaneously. No hierarchy — everyone has equal access.

PRIVACY FIRST
TableTogether respects one principle: food is shared, bodies are not. Recipes and meal plans sync across your household. Personal nutrition logs, goals, and insights stay private to you — encrypted in your personal iCloud storage.

WORKS EVERYWHERE
iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Plan on iPad, cook on iPhone, shop with your watch, display on TV.
