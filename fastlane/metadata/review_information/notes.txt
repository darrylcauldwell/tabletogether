TableTogether is a meal planning and nutrition tracking app for households.

HEALTHKIT USAGE:
- Reads: weight, height, biological sex, date of birth (for BMR/TDEE estimates)
- Writes: dietary energy, protein, carbohydrates, fat (from user-confirmed meal logs)
- HealthKit data is used solely for personal health management, never for marketing or advertising
- Users must explicitly connect to Apple Health; the app is fully functional without it

NUTRITION ESTIMATES:
- Sourced from USDA FoodData Central (public domain, lab-verified) and Open Food Facts (ODbL community database)
- AI parsing uses Apple's on-device FoundationModels framework (iOS 26+) with regex fallback — no data leaves the device
- All estimates are labelled "Quick Estimate" with per-ingredient transparency ("How did we estimate?")
- A nutrition disclaimer is accessible via Settings > About > Nutrition Disclaimer

DATA PRIVACY:
- Shared data (recipes, meal plans, grocery lists) uses CloudKit Shared Database
- Personal data (meal logs, nutrition targets, insights) uses CloudKit Private Database — encrypted and never accessible to other household members
- No personal health information is stored in shared iCloud containers
- Food search queries to USDA/Open Food Facts are anonymous (food name only, no user identifiers)

NO ACCOUNT REQUIRED:
- The app uses CloudKit with the user's Apple ID. There is no separate account creation, login, or password.

TESTING:
- Toggle "Demo Data" in Settings to see sample recipes, meal plans, and household members
- The "Describe it" meal logging feature can be tested with any food description (e.g. "two eggs on toast with butter")
