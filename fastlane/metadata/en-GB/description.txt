TableTogether is a meal planner for people who share a kitchen.

Plan your week. Cook with confidence. Track nutrition on your own terms. Everything syncs across your household via iCloud — but your personal data stays personal.

PLAN TOGETHER
Drag recipes onto a visual week planner. Smart suggestions learn your household's favourites and gently surface new ideas. Copy last week's plan or start fresh.

RECIPES — THREE WAYS IN
Build recipes by hand. Import from any recipe website. Or describe what you have and let AI generate a recipe — choose your cuisine, cooking style, time, and dietary needs.

COOK STEP BY STEP
Full-screen Cooking Mode with large text, a built-in timer, and an ingredient checklist. Designed for messy hands and busy kitchens.

SHOP SMARTER
Mark what's already in your pantry. Everything else flows into a shopping list organised by aisle — ready when you are.

DESCRIBE WHAT YOU ATE
Type a meal in plain language. On-device AI parses the ingredients, then resolves nutrition from USDA FoodData Central and Open Food Facts. See exactly how each estimate was calculated. Tap any ingredient to refine the match.

PRIVATE INSIGHTS
Your meal logs, targets, and trends are personal — never shared with your household. Weekly patterns shown without judgment. No streaks. No scores. Just information.

Optionally connect Apple Health to sync body metrics and log dietary macros automatically.

WORKS EVERYWHERE
iPhone, iPad, and Mac for planning, cooking, and logging. Apple TV as a calm ambient display showing today's meals — like a kitchen whiteboard in the living room.
